description: "In place of the Weekly Writeup this week."

It didn't feel right not to write about this considering that it has been at the top of all our minds this week. And rightly so. And may it continue to occupy our minds forever. I don't want to write much here for now, you could say I'm scared. What I can write is that my view of the world has made a huge shift in the last week, a landslide if you will, and more so in the last five years. I have never considered myself to be a racist, but I am finally understanding the issues that my ignorance has lead me to deny for the last few years. That is, that western society is built on the subjugation, discrimination, and punishment of black and non-white people. White supremacy is a property of the system, and while the world has made a lot of progress, it is clearly not there yet. If George Floyd had been white, he wouldn't have died. That, and countless other examples, is why society is unjust. 

I recognise this post is a mere acknowledgement of the issue, but it is a start.

## Here's some related media I have engaged with this week.

Most importantly, food brings us together. We catch up with old friends over a coffee, we break bread with our enemies, laugh and relive memories. In Ancient Greece, family _(oikos)_ was stipulated to mean "Those who feed together." It really is central to culture, community, and communication.

Food has impacts that reach far beyond the human story. Associated with our food is extraction and consumption; a demand that is directly caused by what we, as individuals, choose to eat. 

The notion that one person can really make a difference seems quaint, but is true even more so in this case. For example, the vegan in the party will often (at least partly) decide the choice of restaurant to eat out at. Solitary choices about food radiate influence in a way other choices do not. By being a vegan at the dinner table, you will necessarily spark conversation simply by the relationship we have with food. Even more so with the strong and polarising opinions people hold when it comes to eating animals. 

Here, we create change by doing. By refusing to eat animals, 70% of the work is already done. Here's the beautiful part: we can create conversation at the global dinner table in the same way. What would it say to the world if one nation, or continent, were to sit at the table as majority vegan?

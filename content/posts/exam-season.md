title: "Weekly Writeup #2 - Exam Season"
date: 2020-05-31T07:28:00+01:00
description: "This is my weekly writeup: a braindump I write every Sunday about the things I'm doing, thinking, reading, etc. (Note: this was written more than a full week before I first had any sort of proper implementation for this site sorted, and I still didn't know what I wanted.)"

Another semester at university wrapping up. Studying for exams and getting coursework submitted - so a short one this week!

# Tools for zettelkasten, tools for life
## Notion
I watched [a tour of Valentin Perez's notion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zWA3anfKGU) setup with Ali Abdaal on youtube. Valentin has his entire life organised on notion and I picked up a few ideas that I'd like to try:
### 1. Great Day Journal
I've tried journalling every night for self reflection. It's good but I often find staring at a blank page finding something to write is difficult at the end of the day. Valentin does a quick self reflection at the start and end of each day by asking the same questions. Here is the template I've started with:

![my daily self reflection in notion](/static/exam-season/notion.png)

### 2. Brainstorming Template
I haven't implemented this one yet. As part of his weekly self-reflection, Valentin works through a brainstorming template to develop ideas. AKA 'Systematic Creativity'. Ideas are generated by answering a set of questions, and developed by putting ideas in the context of time and resource requirements, asking what different notable people would do (e.g. Elon Musk, Gandhi, etc.), or people of different professions (an artist, a biologist etc.). This is something I definitely want to develop after exams.

### 3. Re Human
This is a bit of a broader scope than just a notion setup. Valentin is developing himself in 15 areas in his life, as a way of life. He describes the idea of being a 'renaissance human' better than I can in his [blog post](https://medium.com/renaissance-human-lifestyle/renaissance-human-lifestyle-eccd16e8f4d6). 

> The Renaissance was a period in history when there was a “rebirth” in art, philosophy, and science. Leonardo Da Vinci, who exemplified this rebirth by developing multiple talents is commonly referred to as a “Renaissance Man”.

It's about becoming the best at an intersection of skills. I'd love to try this after my exams are done. Maybe not 15 areas while I'm still at uni! (Or maybe 15 but mostly little skills).

## Zettelkasten
Here we are again, trying to wrangle my head around a workflow that works for me. I'm still using [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), but I have several problems with it.
1. There's no API
2. If the company goes bust, all my data is gone (unless I regularly back it up)
3. They're planning to charge for it.
These are pointed out by [Matt Williams' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c) and he proposes using [orgroam with emacs](https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/introducing_org_roam/). (Side note, I really like the super plan style on [Jethro Kuan's blog](https://blog.jethro.dev/)). It seems to have some interesting uses for programming, like being able to add TODOs in your code, and schedule them for a specific time. Again, I will be looking into this more after exams.

# Meat and plastic
Everyone reading this will be aware of [the environmental impacts of meat production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production.) For a while I had essentially cut all meat apart from chicken from my diet, and I only ate that around twice a week. On Saturday, I [read](https://theintercept.com/2020/05/29/pigs-factory-farms-ventilation-shutdown-coronavirus/) about and [watched](https://youtu.be/UhavFP9f6b4) how *"Iowa Select Farms, has been using a cruel and excruciating method to kill thousands of pigs that have become commercially worthless due to the coronavirus pandemic."* While I think the agriculture industry here in the UK is generally a lot better (more ethical? less corrupt?), I was totally turned off meat my the article, as well as [this short documentary](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/12/meat-industry-ag-gag-laws/) about big pork. So for the foreseeable future I'm following a pescatarian diet, though may consider buying chicken from a local butcher in the future.

I also read about [*Africas Exploding Plastic Nightmare*](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/19/africa-plastic-waste-kenya-ethiopia/). Here are my key takeaways/ideas from the article:
## 1. Responsibility for our plastic waste is a blame game.
I quote from the article

> “I think there are like eight rivers in the world where close to 90 percent of the waste is going into the oceans,” Perry said on a press call. “None are American rivers.” He was referring to a [2017 study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b02368) that has become a favorite of the plastics industry. Published in Environmental Science and Technology, the study did indeed show that just 10 rivers — eight in Asia and two in Africa — transport between 88 and 95 percent of the global plastics load into the sea.

> But what Perry failed to note is that much of the plastic that has accumulated in these rivers originated in the U.S. and Europe — as did the products that were encased in it. Some 172 metric tons of plastics and its chemical components worth $285 billion were imported into 33 African countries between 1990 and 2017, according to a [study](https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-019-0254-5) published last year in Environmental Sciences Europe. And brand audits have repeatedly found Coke and Pepsi, quintessential American brands, among the [top polluters](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/23/coca-cola-plastic-waste-pollution/) in the world.

## 2. Surprisingly, Africa is leading the way in leading the way in plastic bag bans.
I haven't had time to properly look into this one, but [here's the source](https://qz.com/africa/1622547/africa-is-leading-the-world-in-plastic-bag-bans/) the article links.

## 3. Recycling plastics aren't effective.
In practice, plastics can only really be recycled once, unlike glass.

> “Every stage of post-use treatment degrades the functional quality of the polymer,” Kenneth Geiser, emeritus professor at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, explained of the molecules that make up various plastics. “Polymers generally lose strength, stability, and moldability as the linear molecular bonds are severed or broken during recycling processes” ... “So even if in the laboratory, a polymer can be remelted and reformed, it is not so easily accomplished in actual practice.”

I'd like to read into all this more, specifically the chemistry of recycling plastics. The article goes into much detail about the failure of companies such as Coke and Exxon Mobil to respond to the crisis. Or rather, their sharade of responding to the crisis. 

# Space
Lot's of cool things happened in space this week.

## Virgin Orbit
They conduced their first test flight of Launcher One. [Things didn't go to plan](https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1265023753970302976) but they got a wealth of useful data!

## Starship Prototype SN4 goes bang
A Ground Service Equipment error caused the RUD of SN4. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIh4aLX3cZQ)

## Crew Dragon
Absolutely amazing to see NASA and SpaceX launch astronauts! I'll be [tuning in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZsnKGV8TE) to watch Bob and Doug dock with the ISS at around 1422UTC May 31st. 

# Learning
Looking at using nextjs to rewrite our rails app from the software engineering module we finished this semester. Basically, we hated rails as a team, and it's too powerful for what could be a static site. It was also an absolute pain to deploy the rails app with ES6 modules, and the webpack configuration didn't work on the university's servers. I think NextJS is a good alternative, for now all pages will be statically rendered but we want the option to expand in the future. I'm also planning on using it for another project. I don't think I want to reveal either of these projects yet, but I'm super excited for them!

# Reading, Watching, Listening
I've not had much time this week, so fewer reccomendations.

## Books
I'm currently about 35% through *Cloud Atlas* by *David Mitchell* on [reccomendation from Bill gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2020)

## Videos
A beautiful animation of a section from John Greens *The Anthropocene Reviewed* podcast from the wonderful *Kurzgesagt*. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgnlkJPga4)

## Podcasts
If you only listen to one podcast this week, it's got to be [*Nuclear Fusion Propulsion 101* by *No Dumb Questions*](https://www.nodumbquestions.fm/listen/2020/5/22/084-nuclear-fusion-propulsion-101).

## Music
[*Challenger Part 1 - Flight* by *Flight by We Lost The Sea*](https://open.spotify.com/track/6mwKOi2DYkVZyVxTCdU6bZ?si=TiOVT-SiR8ym6bT-4zLu_w) (get comfy for this one!)

This is a book excerpt from [The Future We Choose by Christiana Figueres & Tom Rivett-Carnac.](https://globaloptimism.com/the-future-we-choose-book/)

# Right now
- Take a deep breath and decide that collectively we can do this, and that you will play your part. You will be a hopeful visionary for humanity through these dark days. From this moment, despair ends and tactics begin.

- Decide that you will be part of the politics of the future. You will vote for, campaign for, and support candidates who champion emissions reductions. Reject the politics of nostalgia. For the next ten years, this will be your number-one political priority.

- Commit to reducing you impact on the climate by more than half of what it is today by 2030. Aim for 60 per cent. Just because right now you don't know how you will do so does not need to stop you. We are all learning.

# Today or tomorrow
- Determine where your principal elected officials stand on climate change; write to them about your commitments and let them know. Tell them you are watching.

- Choose at least one day of the week to go meat free and decide how soon you will add more days to that commitment.

- Think big. How do you most impact climate change, and what big things can you do the effect a regenerative future?

- Tell others about your commitments, in person or on social media. Don't be shy! Invite others to follow suit. Your example will motivate them.

# This week
- Share your personal plan to reduce emissions by more than half with your partner, kids and friends, and invite them to do so as well. Preserving the future should be joyful. Have fun with it.

- Take some actions and stick with them over time - it will give you momentum, Reduce daily energy use, bike instead of driving a car, switch you energy supplier to 100 per cent clean. It's all good and all needs doing. Consider what else you can do, while remembering there is still much to be done.

- Go outside and look around. This world is damaged and hurting, but it is also beautiful as a whole. Pay attention to something you have forgotten - emerging leaves in spring or the frost on dead leaves in the winter. Feel the gratitude we owe the Earth for her bounty and beauty.

# This Month

- Find out who in you vicinity is organising political action involving climate change. Attend meetings and meet concerned citizens. Go to demonstrations and marches! Allow yourself to be inspired by the miracle of committed groups intent on changing the world.

- Start a conversation with someone who is not active on climate change with a view towards understanding their stance and gently enlarging their awareness of the crisis from their perspective.

- Enact your commitments: What precisely will you do this year? How will it affect you and your family? How will you begin to apply changes you plan to make?

- Challenge you consumerism. Look at what you have bought, and ask yourself whether it brings you joy. Question your impulses to buy more, and begin to see how liberating it i to buy less.

- Start a mindfulness practice, perhaps a breathing exercise of gratitude. Do it every day, if only for a few minutes. Learn to create a gap of light between yourself, the world, and your reactions.

- Plant trees, as many as you can. Look for a local group doing tree planting. Get out there when you can, and when you can't, support others to do so.

- Understand you privilege in relation to others, and commit to helping level the playing field for all.

# This Year

- Be political in your daily life. Seek collective opportunities to advance the cause of emissions reductions. It will inspire you to help you feel you are part of a shared endeavour. Engage regularly in direct action if that is possible where you live. VOTE!

- Be consistent. You may have changed you electricity to 100 per cent renewable energy,  rethought your commute, changed your air travel habits and altered your diet. If you can sustain your effort for the first year, you stand a good chance of doing so every year. Recognise you accomplishment.

# By 2030
- Deliver you plan to cut your emissions by more than half. Celebrate your achievement.

- Finance others to plant more trees as a symbol of the fact that you still have some way to go. Trees are good, and the world needs more of them.

- Ensure you have voted in line with these priorities in national and regional elections and been vocal about the fact that you have done so.

- Continue to practise other new habits you have developed.

- Encourage those closest to you - family, friends, loved ones - to be climate conscious.

- Start the plan to reduce your emissions again by more than half over the next decade.

# By 2050

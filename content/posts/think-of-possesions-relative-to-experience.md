I value experiences more than possessions but possessions can enable you to have positive experiences. Sometimes I think about possessions in relation to how they enable experience:

**Experience Rich** objects are those that increase the number or richness of experiences. These could be things like a bicycle, a board game to play with friends, a musical instrument, etc.

**Experience Neutral** objects are those that are neccessary to live your life, or for the maintenance of experience rich objects. Things like your toothbrush, cookware, or the bicycle pump.

**Experience Negative** objects actually hamper the ability to have experiences, capturing your time and attention by cluttering your physical or mental environment. They could be duplicates of neutral or positive objects.

In order to live a life rich in experience, it is necessary to remove negative objects from it. 

Objects might float between the classes over time. For example you buy a guitar, only you're soon to realise you don't enjoy playing it. And that's totally ok - it's time to decide whether you should let go of the guitar and move on.

During my month on minimalism for June, I will be exploring ideas related to minimalism, and seek to live a more minimal lifestyle.

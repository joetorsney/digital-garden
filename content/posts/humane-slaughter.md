description: "Why we cannot justify the slaughtering of animals"

Most people say that as long as the animal has had a good life, and it's slaughtered humanely, that it's ok to eat meat. Firstly, if you ask someone to define what humane means, it'll be something close to the [dictionary definition](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02k4OCL_WVYq0VAmBUbcf5kEGU2gQ%3A1593583505803&ei=kSf8XvXTMJih1fAP58u_mAY&q=humane+definition&oq=humane+defin&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgAMgcIABBGEPkBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoECAAQQzoFCAAQgwE6BwgAELEDEEM6BQgAELEDOgQIABAKOggIABAWEAoQHlD3qTJYwMAyYKTLMmgCcAB4AIABZYgB_QeSAQQxMi4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab) *"having or showing compassion or benevolence"*. Now, even if you killed me in a 'humane' way (I had no idea what was coming, I had lived a happy life etc.), it'd be morally wrong because I have autonomy, I am a being, and I want to live. Animals are also beings, they are autonomous, and they want to live[^1]. Thus, even if we assume the world is perfect with respect to how we treat and slaughter animals, 'humane slaughter' is an oxymoron. Of course the world isn't perfect.

Many animals are given an electric shock which is supposed to stun them before being hung and having their throats cut. However, the stunning can be ineffective, especially when performed by rushed and underpaid abattoir workers with little training. Thus, many animals are still conscious and die from blood loss. Another method of stunning is via a bolt gun, spring-loaded gun that is supposed to knock the animal unconscious, or a rifle. [These methods can also be ineffective](https://faunalytics.org/effective-captive-bolt-stunning/#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20that%2C%20through,common%20way%20of%20stunning%20cows%3F&text=The%20study%20found%20that%20out,just%2084.1%25%20were%20adequately%20stunned.),  as rely on the farmer having perfect aim, which is difficult when the animal is scared, confused, and panicked. A single impact or shot can also be ineffective on larger animals (large pigs, sheep, cows), causing even more suffering.

Therefore, when you buy meat we cannot guarantee that the animal has not suffered. And even if it didn't, we still cannot morally justify its death.

Humane slaughter is an oxymoron.

[^1]: At least, [according to Aaron Simmons](https://www.academia.edu/1588616/Do_Animals_Have_an_Interest_in_Continued_Life_In_Defense_of_a_Desire-Based_Approach), "A more promising argument holds that many animals have an interest in continued life insofar as they possess certain enjoyments in life, where animalsâ€™ enjoyments are best understood not merely as fleeting experiences but rather as dispositional desires which animals continue to possess over time.

# Hello, I'm Joseph Torsney

## I am a Computer Science student at The University of Sheffield.

Most of this website is a space for my writing. The primary audience is myself, but I welcome you to take a look. I do a weekly writeup every Sunday - a braindump of all my thoughts, ideas, and things I've been working on in the past week.

This website is deploying with a big list of todos, and it will always be under development.
